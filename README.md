# Java Automatic Unit Test Generation
Unit testing provides the foundation of the Testing pyramid in
traditional approaches and requires a lot of resources to create
and maintain the test suite. We aim to automate the process to
save resources (and avoid tedious work) using symbolic execution frameworks.
## Dependencies
- Java 1.8 (Any JDK should be fine,
  though this project has currently been set up with Amazon Corretto 8)
- Maven
- JUnit
- Z3, used by many symbolic execution modules
- JavaParser
- Soot
